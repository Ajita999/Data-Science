# Data-Science
Exploratory data analysis of publicly available data from the website LendingClub.com from the year 2007 - 2010 using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas built in visualization libraries. Data visualization resulted in finding some relationships/patterns in the data amongst the categories like FICO score, interest rate, annual income, credit policy, etc. Predicted whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full using Random Forest algorithm so that investors can invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.
